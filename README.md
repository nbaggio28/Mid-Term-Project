# Chocolate Bars Data Analysis overview

Its focused on plain dark chocolate with an aim of appreciating the flavors of the cacao when made into chocolate. The ratings do not reflect health benefits, social missions, or organic status.

Each chocolate is evaluated from a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation. A rating here only represents an experience with one bar from one batch. Batch numbers, vintages and review dates are included in the database when known.

3.5 - 3.9 = Highly Recommended
3.0 - 3.49 = Recommended
2.0 - 2.9 = Disappointing
1.0 - 1.9 = Unpleasant
